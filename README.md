## 🎯 Objective

- Strengthen core programming logic
- Master modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Build structured and maintainable code
- Prepare for real-world backend applications
- Develop problem-solving independence

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each folder represents a foundational backend logic project:

- `calculator` → Basic mathematical operations
- `atm-simulator` → Balance, deposit and withdrawal simulation
- `task-manager` → Task creation and management logic
- `financial-control` → Monthly income and expense simulation
